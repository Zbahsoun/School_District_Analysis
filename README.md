# School_District_Analysis

## Overview:

### The school district analysis project focuses on presenting insights about student's math and reading scores for the 9th to 12th grade, school names and school budget. These insights summarize the count, mean, percentages and min & max numbers for each of those variables. In the next section we will be listing the main findings after gathering and analyzing the data.
